# EcoMove

EcoMove is an informative web platform that explores and compares the environmental impact of different vehicle types—petrol, diesel, and electric (EV)—with a focus on emissions, air quality, and sustainability. The project aims to raise awareness and provide data-driven insights to help users make informed choices for a cleaner planet.

## Features

- **Vehicle Emissions Comparison:** Visualize and compare emissions (NOx, CO₂) from petrol, diesel, and electric vehicles.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Access external dashboards for in-depth comparison and prediction analytics.
- **Educational Content:** Learn about the lifecycle impacts of different vehicle types, including the environmental footprint of EV batteries.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Animations:** Engaging transitions and loading screens for a modern user experience.
