            <h2>Our Project</h2>
            <p>
                <!-- Project overview -->
                A focused initiative to study and compare the environmental impact of three major vehicle
                fuel types—<strong>Petrol, Diesel, and Electric</strong>—with a special emphasis on
                <strong>NO<sub>x</sub> (Nitrogen Oxides)</strong> and <strong>CO<sub>2</sub> (Carbon Dioxide)</strong>
                emissions. These pollutants are key contributors to poor air quality and climate change.
            </p>

            <p>
                <!-- Data analysis and research summary -->
                Through extensive data analysis and research, we have measured how each fuel type affects pollution
                levels. While petrol and diesel vehicles are known sources of direct tailpipe emissions, including high
                levels of NO<sub>x</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, our study also considers the often-overlooked environmental
                cost of electric vehicles (EVs).
            </p>

            <p>
                <!-- EVs environmental footprint explanation -->
                EVs are marketed as "clean" alternatives, and while they produce zero tailpipe emissions, our findings
                show that their overall environmental footprint isn't negligible. A major concern is the
                <strong>production and disposal of lithium-ion batteries</strong> used in EVs. These batteries are
                energy-intensive to manufacture, emitting significant CO<sub>2</sub> during mining, refining, and cell
                production processes. Additionally, the lack of widespread battery recycling and challenges in safe
                disposal present growing environmental threats.
            </p>

            <p>
                <!-- Context for India -->
                In the context of <strong>India's rapidly urbanizing transport ecosystem</strong>, this comparison is
                especially critical. Government reports and independent studies (e.g., Drishti IAS, ICCT) highlight that
                NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from conventional fuel vehicles are one of the leading causes of declining
                urban air quality and contribute significantly to the Air Quality Index (AQI).
            </p>

            <p>
                <!-- Project goal statement -->
                Our project doesn't aim to promote or criticize a particular fuel type, but to bring <strong>awareness
                    through data-backed insights</strong>. We provide:
            </p>
            <!-- Key project deliverables -->
            <ul>
                <!-- Use a single <ul> for clarity -->
                <li>Comparative analysis of NO<sub>x</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from Petrol, Diesel, and
                    Electric vehicles</li>
                <li>Correlation between NO<sub>x</sub> emissions and AQI deterioration across fuel types</li>
                <li>Yearly trends in CO<sub>2</sub> data to visualize the impact of vehicle types on environment
                </li>
                <li>Visualization of pollutant trends using interactive dashboards and time-series graphs</li>
                <li>Machine learning-based predictions of future emission levels and their potential AQI impact</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <!-- Conclusion -->
                In conclusion, while the adoption of EVs is a positive move toward reducing urban air pollution, it must
                be backed by sustainable battery manufacturing, recycling infrastructure, and clean energy grids to be
                truly effective. Our research aims to help users, policymakers, and students make informed decisions
                toward a cleaner future.
